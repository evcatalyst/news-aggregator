# API Error Handling & Resilience Strategy

This document outlines the error handling and fallback strategies implemented in the news aggregator application to handle Grok API errors and ensure a consistent user experience.

## Server-Side Error Handling (proxy/server.js)

### Grok API Integration

1. **Improved Status Validation**
   - Now accepts all status codes and handles errors manually for better error messages
   - Detailed error logging for all types of API failures

2. **Multiple Topic Extraction Methods**
   - Pattern 1: "about X" extraction
   - Pattern 2: "show me X news" extraction  
   - Pattern 3: "create a card about X" extraction
   - Keyword extraction from prompt as final fallback

3. **NewsAPI Fallback Strategies**
   - Strategy 1: Fallback to top headlines when specific search fails
   - Strategy 2: Try broader queries using only first keyword
   - Strategy 3: Category-based search for common topics

4. **Response Error Classification**
   - Connection issues: 503 Service Unavailable
   - Timeouts: 504 Gateway Timeout
   - Authentication errors: 401 Unauthorized
   - Rate limits: 429 Too Many Requests
   - Default server errors: 500 Internal Server Error

### News API Resilience

1. **Enhanced Query Processing**
   - Query sanitization to remove problematic characters
   - Truncation of overly long queries
   - Appropriate categorization of ambiguous queries

2. **Automatic Retry Logic**
   - Configurable number of retry attempts
   - Exponential backoff between retries
   - Different strategies for each retry

## Client-Side Error Handling (frontend)

### API Helper Module (src/utils/apiHelper.js)

1. **makeChatRequest Function**
   - Handles retries with query simplification
   - Manages timeouts consistently
   - Provides detailed error context

### Date Formatting Resilience (app.js, tabulator-init.js)

1. **Multi-Layer Date Formatting Strategy** (Added June 11, 2025)
   - Primary: Luxon-based custom formatter (`luxonDatetime`)
   - Secondary: Native Date object fallback in `formatDateSafe()`
   - Final: Empty string with console error for complete failures
   
2. **Date Format Error Detection**
   - Try-catch blocks around all date parsing operations
   - Detailed console logging for parsing failures
   - Invalid placeholder text for unparseable dates
   
3. **Tabulator-Luxon Integration**
   - Multiple global exposure methods for Luxon (`window.luxon`, `window.DateTime`)
   - Version compatibility checks between CDN and npm packages
   - Initialization module to ensure formatters are registered before table rendering

2. **getNewsDirectly Function**
   - Direct fallback to news endpoint when chat fails
   - Guaranteed results even when specific queries fail

### ChatSidebar Component

1. **User Experience During Failures**
   - Clear error messages based on failure type
   - Always attempts to show some news content
   - Provides helpful suggestions after errors
   - Random tips to help users form better queries

2. **Recovery Strategies**
   - Automatic creation of generic news cards when specific searches fail
   - Graceful degradation to top headlines
   - Visual indicators of fallback behavior
   - Timeout handling with clear messaging

## Testing Fallback Scenarios

To test the fallback mechanisms:

1. **Grok API Failure**: 
   - Temporarily use an invalid API key
   - Send complex, difficult-to-process queries

2. **NewsAPI Failures**: 
   - Test with unusual characters that might break queries
   - Test with empty responses

3. **Network Issues**: 
   - Test with slow connections to trigger timeouts
   - Test with connection interruptions

## Known Limitations

1. The fallback keyword extraction is basic and may not always capture the intent correctly
2. Category matching is limited to predefined categories in NewsAPI
3. When both Grok and NewsAPI fail completely, only error messages are shown

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a caching layer to reduce API calls and improve resilience
2. Add more sophisticated natural language processing for keyword extraction
3. Create a local trending topics store to use as fallback
4. Implement user preference learning to better handle repeated queries
