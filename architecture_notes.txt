Intent: Refactor frontend for ag-Grid news cards, card pinning/updating, debug toggle, and improved sidebar UX.
Summary:
- Integrated ag-Grid for news results in stacked cards (sortable, filterable, groupable).
- Added ability to pin, update, and remove cards.
- Sidebar: debug toggle, smaller font, card action controls (create/update with dropdown), removed company icon/reference.
- Debugging is on by default in dev, toggle in sidebar.
Files changed: frontend/app.js, frontend/package.json, frontend/index.html, README.md

Intent: Fix NewsAPI 500 error on default load when no query is provided.
Summary:
- Updated proxy/server.js to fallback to /v2/top-headlines with country=us if no query is provided, preventing 500 errors.
- Ensured only NewsAPI-supported params are sent to the API.
Files changed: proxy/server.js

2025-06-08
Intent: Improve ag-Grid reliability, error handling, and developer workflow.
Summary:
- Switched all ag-Grid CSS/JS to CDN links only; removed local node_modules references.
- Moved ag-Grid CDN script to end of <body> in index.html to guarantee load order.
- Added waitForAgGrid in app.js to delay app initialization until ag-Grid is available, with clear error if not.
- Improved Grok response parsing and debug logging in app.js.
- Added pro forma Playwright/Puppeteer-style UI test (agGridLoad.test.js) for ag-Grid and chat/news card flow.
- Updated documentation and troubleshooting guidance in README.
Files changed: frontend/index.html, frontend/app.js, frontend/agGridLoad.test.js, README.md

2025-01-07
Intent: Fix Docker credential issues and ag-Grid loading problems to unblock development.
Summary:
- Fixed Docker credential helper issues by simplifying ~/.docker/config.json (removed "credsStore": "desktop").
- Resolved ag-Grid loading problems by switching from unreliable CDN to local npm package installation.
- Updated index.html to load ag-Grid from local node_modules with proper script order (ag-Grid before app.js).
- Enhanced app.js with robust ag-Grid detection supporting both modern (createGrid) and legacy (Grid) APIs.
- Removed obsolete version declaration from docker-compose.yml to eliminate warnings.
- Improved rebuild_stack.sh with simplified Docker handling and removed CDN dependency checks.
- All 4/4 Playwright tests now pass reliably.
- Comprehensive README.md overhaul with current architecture, troubleshooting, and development workflow.
Files changed: proxy/rebuild_stack.sh, docker-compose.yml, frontend/index.html, frontend/app.js, README.md, ~/.docker/config.json

Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Docker Issues**: Simplified credential handling, removed desktop credential store dependency
2. **ag-Grid Reliability**: Local npm package installation instead of CDN, improved API detection
3. **Build Process**: Enhanced rebuild script with better error handling and Docker Compose detection
4. **Documentation**: Updated with current state, troubleshooting guides, and architecture diagrams
5. **Testing**: All integration tests now pass consistently
