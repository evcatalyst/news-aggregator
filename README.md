---

## Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Apple Silicon/M1/M2/M3 compatible)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (for local development, optional)
- NewsAPI API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)
- xAI API key from [x.ai](https://x.ai/) for Grok integration

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Navigate
```zsh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd news-aggregator
```

### 2. Set up API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the `proxy/` folder:
```env
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_grok_key_here
```

### 3. One-Command Setup & Run
```zsh
cd proxy && ./rebuild_stack.sh
```

**That's it!** The rebuild script will:
- Install all dependencies (npm packages, Playwright browsers)
- Build Tailwind CSS
- Start Docker containers
- Run health checks
- Display access URLs

### 4. Access Your Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- **Proxy API**: http://localhost:3000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

---

## Development Workflow

### 🚀 The Rebuild Script (Recommended)
The `rebuild_stack.sh` script provides a complete development reset:

```zsh
cd proxy && ./rebuild_stack.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Stops and removes all containers
2. Cleans npm dependencies 
3. Reinstalls all packages fresh
4. Installs Playwright browsers
5. Builds Tailwind CSS
6. Rebuilds and starts Docker containers
7. Runs health checks
8. Shows you access URLs

### 🔄 Manual Development Commands
```zsh
# Start/restart services
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Run tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Build Tailwind CSS manually
cd frontend && npx tailwindcss -i input.css -o tailwind.css

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart frontend
```

### 🧪 Testing
```zsh
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ Card Creation Issues
**In progress!** Sometimes new cards are not created for certain queries.
- Check console for `[ChatSidebar]` debug messages
- Verify the API returned valid articles
- Try a different search query
- See `BUGLOG.md` for more details

#### ❌ Pagination Controls Cut Off
**In progress!** The table pagination controls may be cut off in some cards.
- This has been partially fixed by increasing card height to 270px and adding margin
- If you still see this issue, you can add additional margin to the cards

#### ❌ Tabulator Failed to Load
**Fixed in latest version!** We now use local npm installation instead of CDN, with proper Luxon integration.
- If you still see this, run: `./proxy/rebuild_stack.sh`
- For Luxon dependency errors, check browser console for detailed logs

#### ❌ Docker Credential Issues
**Fixed in latest version!** Simplified Docker configuration removes credential dependencies.
- If you encounter this, the rebuild script handles it automatically

#### ❌ Port Already in Use
```zsh
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -ti:3000 -ti:8080

# Kill processes if needed
docker compose down
```

#### ❌ npm/Node Issues
```zsh
# Clean install everything
./proxy/rebuild_stack.sh
```

#### ❌ API Key Issues
- Verify your `.env` file exists in `proxy/` folder
- Check API keys are valid and have proper permissions
- Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`

#### ❌ Tabulator Date Formatting Issues
**Fixed in latest version!** Date formatting is now handled natively in JavaScript. Luxon is no longer required.
- If you still see date issues, check your browser cache and ensure you are running the latest code.
- See the `formatDateSafe` utility in `frontend/src/utils/dateUtils.js` for details.

### 🐞 Debug Mode
- Debug logging is enabled by default in development
- Toggle debug in the frontend sidebar
- Check browser console for detailed logs with prefixes:
  - `[ChatSidebar]` - Card creation and chat interaction logs
  - `[App]` - Main application state changes
  - `[NewsTable]` - Table rendering and data issues
- View server logs: `docker compose logs proxy`
- Card creation debugging:
  ```javascript
  // Example debug log sequence for card creation
  [ChatSidebar] handleSend: newsResults [...] 
  [ChatSidebar] handleSend: validArticles [...]
  [ChatSidebar] handleSend: newCard {...}
  [ChatSidebar] handleSend: onCreateCard result true|false
  ```

---

## Known Issues (2025-06-11)

- New cards are sometimes not created for certain queries (e.g. 'cats'), or all new searches are added to the same table/card.
- ~~Tabulator dependency issues with Luxon (resolved in latest update)~~
- There is no clear local log of card creation events, making debugging difficult. Debug logging has now been added to `ChatSidebar.jsx`.
- Pagination controls at the bottom of the table can be cut off depending on card/table height (fix is in progress).
- Card creation logic sometimes reports success even when no card was actually created.
- See `BUGLOG.md` for more details and reproduction steps.

## Debugging Tips
- Open the browser console and look for `[ChatSidebar]` logs to trace card creation attempts/results.
- Debug logs are prefixed with tags like `[ChatSidebar]` and contain information about:
  - Card creation attempts
  - News API results
  - Valid article filtering
  - New card creation details
  - Success/failure of card addition
- If a card is not created, check the API response and the debug logs for clues.
- Check `ARCHITECTURE.md` for information about the card creation flow.

  - Moved ag-Grid CDN script to end of <body> in index.html to guarantee load order.
  - Added waitForAgGrid in app.js to delay app initialization until ag-Grid is available, with clear error if not.
  - Improved Grok response parsing and debug logging in app.js.
  - Added pro forma Playwright/Puppeteer-style UI test (agGridLoad.test.js) for ag-Grid and chat/news card flow.
  - Updated documentation and troubleshooting guidance in README.
- **Files Changed:**
  - frontend/index.html
  - frontend/app.js

## Card Creation Process

The application creates news cards through the following flow:

1. User makes a query in the chat interface (`ChatSidebar.jsx`)
2. Request is sent to Grok via the proxy server
3. Response is processed to extract news articles
4. Valid articles are filtered and formatted
5. A card object is created with a unique ID and the formatted articles
6. `onCreateCard()` is called to add the card to the application state
7. Feedback is provided based on the success/failure of card creation

### Debugging Card Creation Issues

If you encounter issues with card creation:

1. Check console logs for messages prefixed with `[ChatSidebar]`
2. Verify that `handleCreateCard` in `App.jsx` is properly detecting duplicates
3. Ensure card height and margins are sufficient for pagination controls
4. Review `BUGLOG.md` for known issues and reproduction steps
5. Check `TODO.md` for planned improvements

### ⚡ 2025-06-11 - Date Formatting Now Native (No Luxon Required)
- **No more Luxon dependency for date formatting in Tabulator!**
- All date formatting is now handled natively in JavaScript for maximum reliability.
- If you see any date formatting issues, check the new `formatDateSafe` utility in `frontend/src/utils/dateUtils.js`.
- The code and documentation have been updated to reflect this change.

#### Troubleshooting Tabulator Date Columns
- If dates do not display, ensure you are using the latest code and have cleared your browser cache.
- The formatter for date columns is now a simple inline function or uses `formatDateSafe`.
- No external date libraries are required for correct display.
